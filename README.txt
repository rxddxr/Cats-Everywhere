README

The Cats Everywhere application is an Android mobile app pilot project.  The core of the application is for users to take and share pictures of their own cats, as well as various objects that look like cats--examples include snow sculptures and clouds.  The goal of the application is to engage users’ support for big cat conservation and develop a community with a shared interest in big cats.  National Geographic will use the application as a platform to engage users in issues facing big cats and perhaps initiatives to save them.  By drawing users to the application through photo sharing, the application will help raise awareness of the vulnerability of big cats and encourage community involvement.

Dependencies: 
Cats Everywhere requires the Standard Android Library & Google API's.
